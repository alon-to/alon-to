### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alon, a recovering Google product manager turned solutions and software engineer living in San Francisco, CA. I develop using JavaScript and Python.

I've historically used this account for private work and to comment on issues, but plan to post some fun little personal projects in the near future.

Thanks for stopping by!
