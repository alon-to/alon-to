### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alon, a recovering Google product manager turned solutions and software engineer living in San Francisco, CA. 

I've historically used this account for private work and to contribute to issues for my favorite open source tools, but will add some fun little personal projects here in the near future. Thanks for stopping by!
